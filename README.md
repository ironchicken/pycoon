## Pycoon

This package provides an implementation of the XML *pipeline* concept:
pipelines of XML processing components (generators, transformers,
serializers) can be constructed which respond to HTTP request path
patterns and return XML documents. The concept is also implemented in
Apache Cocoon from which Pycoon got its name.
